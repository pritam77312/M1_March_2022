•	When it comes to health and fitness, there are only few basic fundamental parameters to look for like height, weight, diet, etc. However, there are indices based on these factors which shows the person fitness figure. These indices are Body mass Index (BMI), Basal metabolic rate (BMR), Fat percentage, and many more components. 

•	This project aims to calculate the above-mentioned indices of a person and give out the fitness check of the person. The person has to input the basic details of height, weight which will be processed to give output. 

•	Thus, the aim of people moving more towards the fitness will lead to overall physical development and enhanced immunity for a healthy well-being. 

## RESEARCH 

Why is maintaining fitness important? 

•When you're young, it's easy to take your body and your health for granted. However, as you age, the importance of maintaining good health becomes more apparent. When you keep your body working well, you enjoy greater energy and fewer aches and pains.
Some more highlights in order to maintain the body are as follows :-

•	Helps You Live Longer: 
 For those determined to get the most out of their body in terms of longevity, there is a whole host of evidence that links staying healthy with longer life. One study went so far as to estimate the link between only drinking alcohol in moderation, not smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet can extend your life by up to 14 years.

•	 Control Your Stress:
The modern world we live in is undoubtedly stressful, with the ability to switch off from work being a significant problem. One of the issues facing us is how to handle stress with exercise. Those who live a healthy lifestyle have been proven in clinical studies to have lower levels of stress and anxiety.

•	Avoid Addictions:
No matter what kind of addiction you are affected by a healthy lifestyle filled with exercise can limit your desire for the addictive substance. Whether your vice of choice is food, drugs, or alcohol, you will find a runner’s high just as addictive.

•	Lower Medical Costs:
This may seem like a no-brainer, but by staying healthy, your medical bills will be significantly lower. Lower medical costs will often lead to fewer debts and a higher credit score. 

## FEATURES

Features: 

•	The person will be giving certain details such as name, age, height, weight, etc. required for the calculation of the fitness indices. 

•	The person will be then giving an input as to which index the person wishes to see for himself.

•	As per the input, corresponding function will be called by the code, and the function will be processing all the input data and the output will be printed accordingly.

•	Thus, this project is a handy tool where person simply gives input and output will be given within no time!
## Defining_Our_System
•	The project is aimed towards calculating the health and fitness indices such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal metabolic rate (BMR), Fat percentage. These are very crucial indices which determine the person’s everyday being and fitness quality. 

•	Thereby, this project is a handy tool where the person has to simply give out basic details which will be processed and the output will be given with a report.

## 4W_&1H
## Who
The project is accessible for everyone. A person has to simply input his basic details such as height, weight, etc. for getting the output.
## What
Upon receiving the inputs, the parameters will be processed and the index person wishes to see will be given as output. 
## When
With increased environmental problems, focus has been on improving immunity and fitness level to survive the harsh environmental conditions such as pollutions, infections, and deadly infections. Thus, with more and more focus into health and fitness, people are motivated to work towards and it for a heathier lifestyle.
## Where
Only a device supporting the applicated will be required for giving in the inputs and getting the desired output. 
## How
The code will be implemented with functions which will be called as per the index person wishes to see, and the function will be processing the input data given by the person. The output will be then printed giving the health check of the person.
